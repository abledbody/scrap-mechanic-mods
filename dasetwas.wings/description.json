   "description" : "Slightly more advanced flight dynamics for wings.\n\n[b]Disable the original Wings mod before enabling this one.[/b] This is an alternative option, not an add-on, and will not work if both mods are enabled.\n\nPlanes you built with DasEtwas's wings mod can still be loaded in using this mod and vice versa, but the behavior of wings is different, so there's no guarantee the planes will work as well in either mod.\n\nIf you want to know exactly what I've changed, I've bumped up the air density, but the wings now stall out if the angle of attack is too high. When stalled, wings produce less lift and more drag. There's a small transition window between unstalled and completely stalled.\n\nThanks to DasEtwas for letting me use and modify his code, and for making [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1390938191]the original wings mod.[/url]",
